The deciduous trees (elm, birch and larch) at the base of the cliff are relatively new growth. There are indications that a forest fire burned through the area 20 years ago or more. The forest floor is mostly free of thick undergrowth and there is enough open grass to graze a couple of dozen horses or mules for a day or two.</p>",
