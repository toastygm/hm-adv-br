Though he was the eldest grandchild of the jeweller, his bastard status made him unpopular even as a child. He was brought up in the family business, but always had to work twice as hard for half the recognition. He completed his apprenticeship and left Paran to become a journeyman. His departure was not mourned and his grandfather made his status clear “I have clothed you, fed you and given you a trade for the sake of my daughter. You are eighteen; I owe you nothing more. Never return, I declare our relationship concluded.”</p>\n<p>Klinla has travelled extensively throughout Hârn and Lythia, including spending almost twenty years living in Azeryan. He earned the title master jeweller and has made a considerable fortune trading gold, silver and gems. His exquisitely crafted jewellery is in great demand among the wealthy and elite of Hârn. Perhaps because of the rejection by his family, a somewhat homely appearance and squinty eyes, Klinla compensates by being an exceptionally friendly man. He has a knack for being warm and comforting, quickly putting new acquaintances and customers at ease. He is well known as an honest and upstanding businessman. His word is his bond and he has many friends in high places as a result.</p>\n<p>Klinla travels continuously from city to city, with significant amounts of precious metals and gems. Because of this, he hires only the best and most reliable sellswords to provide security for his goods and act as his bodyguards. He pays top wages and rewards loyalty highly. His network of contacts includes wealthy guildsmen and nobility. He rarely stays in inns, as he has dozens of standing invitations to stay with his many satisfied customers.</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>This character is taken from “Friends, Foes, and Followers, Vol. 1” on Lythia.com (https://www.lythia.com/game_aides/friends-foes-followers-volume-1/), by Kerry Mould, with illustrations by Richard Luscheck and Juha Makkonen, and is “fanon”, a derivative work of copyrighted material by Columbia Games Inc. and N.

In 714, while visiting Lorkin, Ylina witnessed the brutality of Clan Geldestaar against the Jarin. She tried to intervene on the behalf of a Jarin woman, but was ultimately forced to flee Lorkin after killing one of Jaus Geldestaar’s men.</p>\n<p>Since fleeing Lorkin Ylina has lost faith in Sarajin, stopped using her clan name, and started smuggling weapons to the Jarin. She has also honed her physical abilities into an impressive fighting trim, with almost no body fat. She is a creature of steel and whipcord, fuelled by anger. The only people she hates more than Clan Geldestaar are the Crimson Dancers. At a distance, Ylina is sometimes mistaken for an adolescent male.</p>\n<p>Ylina has contacts among the Jarin of Azadmere. They are the source of the weapons she smuggles to the Jarin of Orbaal. She has also gifted several Khuzan-made weapons to Noron to allow her and her goods safe passage through his territory. She typically moves weapons in small batches by mule, no more than one or two mules at a time. She usually portrays herself as a travelling weaponcrafter. Her skill in this area is not exceptional, but is adequate to keep up the pretence. She has been known to hire Taelda or others to help her move her cargo. Rebel groups pay her what they can and she sometimes moves stolen goods for them.</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>This character is taken from “Friends, Foes, and Followers, Vol. 1” on Lythia.com (https://www.lythia.com/game_aides/friends-foes-followers-volume-1/), by Kerry Mould, with illustrations by Richard Luscheck and Juha Makkonen, and is “fanon”, a derivative work of copyrighted material by Columbia Games Inc. and N.

Ealfric was adopted into the yeoman’s clan and raised as their son. When he turned 18, they told him of the circumstances of his birth.

This bored him and so he sought work in the north. There, he participated in several seasons of skirmishing with the Copper Hook in the service of the Earl of Selvos. He earned a formidable reputation as an archer and skirmisher. The Rethemi even offered a sizable bounty for him by name. Eventually he left the Earl’s service and drifted east, taking work as a mercenary.</p>\n<p>Ealfric is a passive soul, accepting things as they happen. He has a great sense of humour and a taste for bad puns. A mysterious aura surrounds him and he doesn’t talk much about his past.

Born into a successful clan, he entered the family shipwright business at twelve. He showed tremendous natural talent and promise, developing swiftly over the next seven years. He had no problem graduating to journeyman. He travelled widely, collecting twelve recommendations in just two years, making him a master shipwright in his own right. Not wanting to return to Ivinia, he travelled to Orbaal where he accepted a position with Master Taareskeld in Geldeheim as a bonded master.</p>\n<p>A creative, inventive, innovative and artistic master, Husraas was soon at odds with his boss over the best way to complete several projects. Unfortunately, when Husraas gets excited or stressed, he has a very severe stutter. Master Taareskeld frequently used Husraas’ speech impediment to mock him, belittle his ideas and imply that he was stupid. A brilliant shipwright, this infuriated Husraas. Finally, the two came to blows and had to be physically separated by the journeymen. Husraas packed up his belongings and left the next morning.</p>\n<p>Desperate to depart as quickly as possible, he refused to wait for the next ship and instead joined a merchant caravan heading south overland. Trained as a huscarl in his youth, Husraas signed on as a caravan guard in return for wages and free food. He has some vague ideas about perhaps heading south to Melderyn or east to Tharda, Kanday or Rethem. At this point he just wants to get as far away from Geldeheim as he can. No one in the caravan is aware he is actually a shipwright. He has two pack mules loaded with his personal belongings including letters of reference and his large collection of tools.</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>This character is taken from “Friends, Foes, and Followers, Vol. 1” on Lythia.com (https://www.lythia.com/game_aides/friends-foes-followers-volume-1/), by Kerry Mould, with illustrations by Richard Luscheck and Juha Makkonen, and is “fanon”, a derivative work of copyrighted material by Columbia Games Inc. and N.

{"_id":"bJBeX08KeJrcPxGL","name":"_Overview","content":"<p><span style=\"0font-size:12pt\\&quot;\"><strong>Difficulty: Low to Moderate</strong></span></p>\n<p>The Bloody Raven is a \"Adventure Module\"; it describes the discovery of an abandoned Khuzdul outpost.</p>\n<p>This mini-adventure is suitable for use as a fill-in between larger adventures in any campaign, a sidetrack to allow the PCs to discover a hideout, or as a location for a climactic battle with a hated enemy. It is generic enough that it could be located in any kingdom on Hârn, though it would work best in Kaldor or Orbaal. It may be played at anytime of the year, though winter will make discovering the back door much more challenging.</p>\n<p>This module is based on the \"<a href=\"https://www.lythia.com/adventures/bloody-raven/\">The Bloody Raven</a>\" fanon; please see @Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.4dm80LX9MRQV12cS]{Credits} for more information.</p>\n<p>The location of this adventure is around and within the <a href=\"https://github.com/toastygm/hm-loc-ko\">Khuzdul Outpost</a>.  That module should have already been loaded; see that module for details on the scenes and descriptions of the outpost.</p>\n<h2>Using this module with Non-HârnMaster systems</h2>\n<p>This module, with the exception of the Actors, is system-agnostic.  See the section below on NPCs for details about the villans who are provided as HârnMaster Actors; these details may be used to generate appropriate statistics for your game system.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Lead-Ins</h2>\n<h3>Caravan Guards</h3>\n<p>The PCs have hired on as escorts to a merchant and are en route from one location to another. They stop just off the trail in the natural alcove of a limestone cliff and set up camp for the night.</p>\n<h3>A Little Assistance Please</h3>\n<p>A sometimes-shifty NPC acquaintance of the PCs comes across the outpost by accident. After failing to find a way in, he decides he needs to recruit a little muscle, the PCs.</p>\n<h3>The Non-Accident</h3>\n<p>The NPC who finds the outpost is actually a Khuzdul agent sent to recover one of the “Keys of Hrazadar” (hidden in the outpost). He knew exactly where it was and is using the PCs as pawns. He cares only about the key, they can have everything else.</p>\n<h2>Setting</h2>\n<p>The adventure begins on a wilderness section of road or trail. The four caravan routes out of Tashal (the Salt Route, Genin’s Trail, the Fur Road and Noron’s Way) are the best choices. The location should be at least a day’s travel from civilization. If the GM wishes to be kind, the site of the outpost should be off a little used “short-cut” which is only know to a few travellers. This minimizes the chance of interruption while searching for the entrance.</p>\n<p>Alternately, the section of road could be deep in the heart of civilized territory, just a mile from the local village. The area should be well known, a convenient place to collect stone and a popular place for the local teens to sneak off to and have the occasional party. The location should be far enough away that the PCs will be able to discover the back door without attracting immediate attention, however, later attention may be a useful plot device for the GM.</p>\n<p>The GM is also encouraged to place this outpost in unlikely places, such as just north of the local map for Caer Minarsas. This makes getting into the site a real challenge and its value as a hideout immeasurable, especially if the PCs are operating on the shady side of the law.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>The Khuzdul constructed the outpost during the Codominium times as an outpost, way station and hunting lodge. It was abandoned over 1000 years ago and has remained undisturbed for a millennia.</p>\n<h3>Opening</h3>\n<p>The PCs are travelling through the wilderness. At the end of the day, they decide to stop just off the trail for the night. They set up camp along the edge of a limestone cliff about forty feet high. An alcove in the cliff offers protection from the wind and offers protection from attack on three sides. An old campfire ring indicates that others have camped here before. The PCs establish camp, set a watch and retire for the night.</p>\n<p>During the night, a raven, sitting on a cliff ledge squawks continually in protest at the human intrusion. Finally, an irate NPCs mutters a curse, crawls out of his bedroll and throws a rock at the “Bloody Raven”. The rock misses the bird but hits one of the shutters that are delicately balanced in the outpost’s crossbow loops. It falls inward making a loud, echoing crash, definitely not natural, and wakes all of the other members of the party.</p>\n<p>If one of the PCs doesn’t think of it, one of the NPCs scales the cliff to investigate the strange sound. Once at the level of the ledge, they call for a torch. They stick their arm deep into the strange crevice revealing the crossbow gallery and guardroom, revealing tantalising glimpses of obviously artificially carved rooms.</p>\n<h2>Objective</h2>\n<p>The objective of this adventure is a straightforward dungeon crawl, with the prize being the dungeon itself. The first obstacle is trying to determine how to get into the tunnels. Once the PCs have discovered and opened the back door, the outpost is small enough to be explored in a single session. There are a few small treasures, but nothing game un-balancing. In fact, if the PCs chose to keep the outpost for their own, it can be an excellent way to separate them from their excess cash as they go about restoring it.</p>\n<h2>Occupants</h2>\n<p>This mini-adventure is designed as a puzzle and can be easily played without any opponents. However, that does not mean that a GM cannot choose to add a few surprises for the PCs to deal with.</p>\n<p><strong>Imagined: </strong>To ensure a constant supply of fresh air, the Khuzdul drilled a number of small horizontal shafts from the complex out to the downwind side of the cliff. These ventilation shafts sometimes act as windpipes, especially when there is a strong breeze. This creates all sorts of moans, whistles and other sounds. They can also cause torches to flicker and even blow out, raising tensions among paranoid PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>Mundane: </strong>There are several ways into the outpost. The above-mentioned ventilation shafts allow small animals (such as bats, squirrels, weasels and the like) to enter from the cliff face. The large drainpipe in the storeroom allows medium sized animals (badgers, foxes and most dangerous of all, a wolverine) to enter from the rocks at the base of the cliff. Such mundane animals can be used to create tension. If the GM wishes to introduce combat into the scenario, it is suggested that they add a wolverine into the storeroom [room 4]. It has claimed the room as its den. Hints, such as sounds of movement and a harsh musky smell (totally unfamiliar to anyone with less than Tracking 90) may alert the PCs to something ominous. The wolverine will not attack immediately; rather it will bare its teeth, raise the hair on its back, stick up its bushy tail, and make a low growl. If the PCs back away, the wolverine will most likely retreat down the drain and flee.</p>\n<p><strong>Supernatural: </strong>During the rush to close up the outpost, one of the Khuzdul slipped and fell from the escape ladder. He struck his head, dying instantly. His companions checked on him and when they determined he was dead, they laid his body to rest in the hall. Unfortunately, in the rush, his soul was not properly commended to Siem. As a result, the poor fellow’s soul has been condemned to walk the outpost forever looking for the way out. The ghost of Akthul Narag will most commonly be encountered on the upper level, especially in and around the site of his death at the base of the escape ladder. His next most preferred location is in the main hall where his body was laid to rest. Nothing remains of his body.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.cpLtOPPmFNmXFt7H]{Convention Play}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.gR0QIwRN2AepOKQ9]{Afterward}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>NPCs</h2>\n<p>The following are suggested NPCs for use with this adventure.  Journal entries are provided for those using systems other than HârnMaster.</p>\n<table style=\"0width:99.1477%;height:51px\\&quot;\" border=\"\\&quot;1\\&quot;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"0height:17px\\&quot;\">\n<td>Name</td>\n<td>HârnMaster Actor</td>\n<td>Journal Entry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:17px\\&quot;\">\n<td>Arwalin of Rogila (Guide)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm3-fffv1.actors.q57uLJi7Vt34DjOC]{409-1 Huntsman - Arwalin of Rogila}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.qkMmJlqwY0ytStk9]{Arwalin of Rogila}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:17px\\&quot;\">\n<td>Klinla of Vebelirky (Guildsman)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm3-fffv1.actors.t4zG9cK9yT1qVGI5]{313-1 Jeweller - Klina of Vebelirky}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.0xwwt1nthOWpx3Ew]{Klinla of Vebelirky}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:17px\\&quot;\">\n<td>Otto (Klinla's Bodyguard)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm3-fffv1.actors.HDRSNCscXIBC8Rxv]{115-1 Mercenary MF - Otto}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.DvULxLDJdBu091bs]{Otto}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"0height:17px\\&quot;\">\n<td>Gathric of Deschu (Klinla's Manservant)</td>\n<td>\n<p>@Compendium[hm3-fffv1.actors.p0Fuj2jIfStY3daR]{417-1 Servant - Gathric of Deschu}</p>\n</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-br.journals.mjIJyWaYthXSJDA6]{Gathric of Deschu}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Suggested PCs</h2>\n<p>The following are suggested PCs for this adventure if run as a one-shot (single session adventure).

His guide, Arwalin, suggests that the four of them would be too vulnerable on the trail and suggests recruiting other travellers to add safety in numbers. Arwalin makes it known through the taverns of Tashal that he is assembling a caravan. The PCs are all travelling to Orbaal for their own reasons and join up. Although Klinla is the richest and most important member of the group, and nominally the leader, it is clear that Arwalin is actually running the caravan. The PCs will primarily deal with Arwalin.</p>\n<p>The group leaves Tashal and makes their way to Olokand and from there up the Fur Road. They make a final stop at Loban Manor before heading into the wilderness. The adventure takes place at a campsite eight leagues (two watches, one day’s trail march by foot) from Loban. The group sets up camp without incident. The PCs make themselves comfortable while Gathric tends to Klinla and Otto. Arwalin scouts out the area. The PCs and NPCs set up a night watch schedule and everyone goes to bed. During the night they hear a raven cawing.

He has worked in the same house since he was sixteen, fetching water, cutting firewood, carrying parcels and escorting his mistress in her daily forays into town. His size and skill with a club make him a formidable escort for his employers and he can often be seen carrying a load of goods for them during the day or a torch during the night. He is also the jack-of-alltrades handyman, repairing broken items around the house. He sleeps in the kitchen near the fire and is a light sleeper waking at the slightest sound. His cudgel is always close at hand.</p>\n<p>The second of five children, Gathric went to live with his maternal grandfather after his mother died and his father remarried. Twelve years old at the time, he and his stepmother hated each other openly, which made him unpopular with his father. His grandfather taught him to sing and play the drums. He is good enough that he is sometimes invited to sing and play at the local tavern.</p>\n<p>When he turned sixteen, his grandfather found him a job as a servant where he has worked for the last eleven years. A big lad, five foot nine inches with a heavy frame he weighs 173lbs. His fair complexion, blond hair, hazel eyes and good looks are marred only by a broken nose and scars on his forehead he earned in a bar brawl. He is left-handed and has rough calloused hands from regular heavy labour. He is kind and flirtatious with women, which has earned him a reputation as a ladies man and a girlfriend with an illegitimate baby daughter. He is careless, often not paying attention to his duties and is forgetful of the time. Since he was very young, Gathric has had the odd quirk of sneezing when he walks out into sunlight.</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>This character is taken from “Friends, Foes, and Followers, Vol. 1” on Lythia.com (https://www.lythia.com/game_aides/friends-foes-followers-volume-1/), by Kerry Mould, with illustrations by Richard Luscheck and Juha Makkonen, and is “fanon”, a derivative work of copyrighted material by Columbia Games Inc. and N.

When he was just a child, his father was killed in a hunting accident by the local baron. To make amends, the baron provided for the family and took Arwalin into his service as a huntsman when he was old enough. After a decade of duty, Arwalin developed a serious case of wanderlust. He sought and was granted permission to take leave of his duties and travel. Since that time he has travelled throughout Hârn.</p>\n<p>While in Kaldor, he spent time at the Peonian church in Bromeleon. The priests took a liking to him and he spent several months there working as a lay brother. Later, he escorted an iterant priest, Father Braeld, for nearly a year, crisscrossing Kaldor. When his work was finished, Arwalin then took his leave again and headed east.</p>\n<p>Skilled in the wilderness, Arwalin has little trouble feeding himself in the wilderness. If he runs afoul of the law, he bears a scroll naming him as the baron’s liegeman. He drifts from region to region, finding work as his money runs out and taking odd jobs. He has worked as a mercenary, though he has little taste for killing humans.</p>\n<p>At thirty-three years old, Arwalin wants to settle down, however a serious kick to the groin when he was a teenager has rendered him sterile, making it more difficult to find a wife since he knows he can’t have children. He has no pressing urge to return home, as he knows his mother and sisters are well taken care of. If something better does not appear in the near future, he is considering entering the Peonian church as a lay brother.</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>This character is taken from “Friends, Foes, and Followers, Vol. 1” on Lythia.com (https://www.lythia.com/game_aides/friends-foes-followers-volume-1/), by Kerry Mould, with illustrations by Richard Luscheck and Juha Makkonen, and is “fanon”, a derivative work of copyrighted material by Columbia Games Inc. and N.
