# HârnWorld Adventure: The Bloody Raven

This module provides the adventure "The Bloody Raven", a mini-adventure for the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting. However, this
adventure could be located in any fantasy setting or location with minimal adaptations.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic, with the exception of Actors.
Detailed descriptions of the actors has been provided in journal entries to facilitate
conversion to other game systems.

On a wilderness section of road or trail, the characters discover an abandoned Khuzdul
(Dwarven) outpost.
